Hardhack Project
Designing:
It seems like we are running into some issues with regard to the set up for the ESP32 Environment so we are deciding to use the Arduino Due.
We fabricasted out own soil moisture sensor using copper wires and a 10k ohm resisitor.


The code was not too complicated. 


Most isses seem to be arising on what sorts of things we as a team can feasibly implement given out current skill set.


Our project focuses on automating soil moisture monitoring and irrigation control to improve plant health and reduce water waste. Since agriculture accounts for 70% of global freshwater withdrawals, we recognize the need for efficient water management to ensure sustainability (ERS, USDA). Overwatering can cause root rot and nutrient leaching, while underwatering can reduce crop yields, with research showing that plants thrive best at 75% water holding capacity (WHC) (PMC). Traditional irrigation methods can be inefficient, wasting up to 60% of water due to evaporation and runoff (MIT News). To tackle this, we designed a system that uses a soil moisture sensor to monitor conditions and a servo-operated water valve to adjust water flow dynamically. This ensures that plants receive the right amount of water, preventing overuse and keeping soil moisture within the optimal range for growth. By automating irrigation, we aim to promote water conservation, healthier crops, and smarter irrigation practices, making our project a valuable solution for both home gardeners and commercial agriculture.
